SETUP:
1.Make sure you have python3 installed on your machine
2.Prepare your unencrypted ck3 save file in the same directory as CK3_history_extractor.py (ironman save files are encrypted)
3.Make sure the template html files are in the same directory as CK3_history_extractor.py
4.Run CK3_history_extractor.py
5.Input your savefile name

If your character traits appear incorrect:
Due to PDX shenanigans this script reqires an up to date trait id lookup file.
I have bundled a tool for generating a new trait id lookup table. Here's how to use it:
1.Prepare 00_traits.txt in the same directory as CK3_lookup_gen.py (it can be found in steamapps\common\Crusader Kings III\game\common\traits)
2.Run CK3_lookup_gen.py

That's about it. In case of issues try to get in contact with me. Preferably on reddit if you came from there
